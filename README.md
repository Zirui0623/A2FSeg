## Usage

* Data Preparation

  - Download the data from [MICCAI 2020 BraTS Challenge](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html).

  - Convert the files' name by

  `python dataset_conversion/Task032_BraTS_2020.py`

  - Preprocess the data by

  `python experiment_planning/nnUNet_plan_and_preprocess.py -t 32 --verify_dataset_integrity`

* Train

  Train the model by

  `python run/run_training_MAML3_channel.py`

 `A2FSeg` is integrated with the out-of-box [nnUNet](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet). Please refer to it for more usage.
